# ETF Selection Guide

All ETFs below are **accumulating** (dividends reinvested internally) and **domiciled in Ireland** — both important for Belgian tax efficiency.

## IWDA — iShares Core MSCI World

- **ISIN:** IE00B4L5Y983
- **Coverage:** ~1,500 companies across 23 developed countries
- **TER:** 0.20%
- **TOB:** 0.12%
- **Exchange:** Euronext Amsterdam (most brokers offer lower fees for this exchange)
- The community favorite for Belgian investors — by far the most liquid world ETF, nearly seven times larger than the next biggest fund
- **Downside:** No emerging markets exposure

## VWCE — Vanguard FTSE All-World

- **ISIN:** IE00BK5BQT80
- **Coverage:** ~3,800 stocks across developed AND emerging markets
- **TER:** 0.19%
- **TOB:** 1.32%
- The "one ETF" approach — broadest diversification in a single fund
- **Downside:** TOB is 11x higher than IWDA (1.32% vs 0.12%), which compounds painfully over decades of monthly investing

## IWDA + EMIM Combo (90/10 split)

- **EMIM ISIN:** IE00BKM4GZ66
- **Coverage:** Same as VWCE when weighted in the right proportions (developed + emerging)
- **TER:** ~0.20% blended
- **TOB:** 0.12% on both
- **Downside:** Managing two ETFs and occasional rebalancing required

## Comparison Table

| | IWDA | VWCE | IWDA + EMIM |
|---|------|------|-------------|
| Coverage | Developed only | Developed + Emerging | Developed + Emerging |
| TER | 0.20% | 0.19% | ~0.20% blended |
| TOB | 0.12% | 1.32% | 0.12% |
| Complexity | Lowest | Low | Medium |
| Rebalancing | None | None | Annual |

## Recommendation

For someone starting out, **100% IWDA** is the pragmatic choice. The TOB difference alone saves significant money over 25+ years of monthly investing. You can add EMIM later if you want emerging market exposure without the 1.32% TOB penalty of VWCE.
