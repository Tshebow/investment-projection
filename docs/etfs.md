# ETF Selection Guide

All ETFs below are **accumulating** (dividends reinvested internally) and **domiciled in Ireland** — both important for Belgian tax efficiency.

## IWDA — iShares Core MSCI World

- **ISIN:** IE00B4L5Y983
- **Coverage:** ~1,500 companies across 23 developed countries
- **TER:** 0.20%
- **TOB:** 0.12%
- **Exchange:** Euronext Amsterdam (most brokers offer lower fees for this exchange)
- The community favorite for Belgian investors — by far the most liquid world ETF, nearly seven times larger than the next biggest fund
- **Downside:** No emerging markets exposure

## VWCE — Vanguard FTSE All-World

- **ISIN:** IE00BK5BQT80
- **Coverage:** ~3,800 stocks across developed AND emerging markets
- **TER:** 0.19%
- **TOB:** 1.32%
- The "one ETF" approach — broadest diversification in a single fund
- **Downside:** TOB is 11x higher than IWDA (1.32% vs 0.12%), which compounds painfully over decades of monthly investing

## IWDA + EMIM Combo (90/10 split)

- **EMIM ISIN:** IE00BKM4GZ66
- **Coverage:** Same as VWCE when weighted in the right proportions (developed + emerging)
- **TER:** ~0.20% blended
- **TOB:** 0.12% on both
- **Downside:** Managing two ETFs and occasional rebalancing required

## CSPX — iShares Core S&P 500

- **ISIN:** IE00B5BMR087
- **Coverage:** ~503 companies — the S&P 500 index (US large-cap)
- **TER:** 0.07%
- **TOB:** 0.12%
- **AUM:** ~€112B
- The cheapest way to get pure US large-cap exposure — lowest TER of any ETF in this list
- The S&P 500 has historically outperformed world indices, though past performance doesn't guarantee future results
- **Downside:** 100% US concentration — no diversification across geographies

## WSML — iShares MSCI World Small Cap

- **ISIN:** IE00BF4RFH31
- **Coverage:** ~3,400 small-cap companies across 23 developed countries
- **TER:** 0.35%
- **TOB:** 0.12%
- **AUM:** ~€5B
- Fills the small-cap gap that IWDA and VWCE miss — small caps historically provide a return premium over long horizons
- Best used as a satellite alongside a core world ETF (e.g., 80% IWDA + 20% WSML)
- **Downside:** Higher TER (0.35%) and more volatile than large/mid-cap funds

## EQQQ — Invesco EQQQ Nasdaq-100

- **ISIN:** IE00BFZXGZ54
- **Coverage:** 100 companies — the Nasdaq-100 index (US tech/growth)
- **TER:** 0.30%
- **TOB:** 0.12%
- **AUM:** ~€9B
- Concentrated bet on US tech and growth — top holdings include Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Meta
- Highest historical returns of any ETF in this list, but also highest volatility
- **Downside:** Extreme sector concentration (tech ~60%), no value/defensive stocks, 100% US

## VEUR — Vanguard FTSE Developed Europe

- **ISIN:** IE00BK5BQX27
- **Coverage:** ~550 companies across 16 developed European countries
- **TER:** 0.10%
- **TOB:** 0.12%
- **AUM:** ~€2.3B
- Useful for investors who want to overweight Europe relative to its share in a global index (~16% in IWDA)
- Low TER (0.10%) makes it an efficient regional tilt
- **Downside:** Regional concentration — no US, Asia, or emerging market exposure

## When to Use Each ETF

**Core holdings** — pick one as your foundation:

- **IWDA** — best starting point for most Belgian investors. Lowest TOB (0.12%), broad developed-world coverage, highest liquidity
- **VWCE** — one-ETF simplicity with emerging markets included, but the 1.32% TOB adds up over decades of DCA
- **IWDA + EMIM** — same coverage as VWCE at 0.12% TOB, at the cost of managing two funds
- **CSPX** — if you're comfortable with 100% US concentration, the 0.07% TER is unbeatable

**Satellite holdings** — add alongside a core for targeted exposure:

- **WSML** — adds the small-cap premium that large/mid-cap world ETFs miss. A 10–20% allocation alongside IWDA gives fuller market coverage
- **EQQQ** — a high-conviction tech/growth tilt. Only add this if you understand you're making a sector bet, not diversifying
- **VEUR** — overweights Europe if you believe the region is undervalued relative to its global index weight

**Starting out?** 100% IWDA remains the pragmatic choice. The TOB savings alone compound significantly over 25+ years. Add satellites later as your portfolio and knowledge grow.
