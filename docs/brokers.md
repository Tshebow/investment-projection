# Broker Comparison

The key trade-off when choosing a broker in Belgium: **convenience vs cost**. Belgian brokers handle all your taxes automatically. Foreign brokers are cheaper but you do more admin yourself.

## Saxo Bank

- **Headquarters:** Copenhagen, Denmark (operates in Belgium via its BinckBank branch, acquired 2019)
- **Tax handling:** Handles TOB, dividend tax, Reynders tax, and CGT automatically
- **Fees:** Buying €1,000 of IWDA costs about €2
- **No foreign account declaration** required (Belgian branch)
- Good choice for beginners who want minimal friction

## Bolero (KBC)

- **Headquarters:** Belgium (KBC subsidiary)
- **Tax handling:** Handles all Belgian taxes automatically
- **Fees:** Buying €1,000 of IWDA costs about €5 — one of the more expensive Belgian brokers
- Offers savings plans for their ETF playlist
- **Caveats:**
  - No fractional shares
  - You must manually fund your account before auto-buys execute
  - Charges €50 per line if you want to transfer out

## DEGIRO

- **Headquarters:** Netherlands (Flatex subsidiary)
- **Tax handling:** Only handles TOB — you must handle dividend tax, Reynders tax, and CGT yourself
- **Fees:** The cheapest option available
- **Securities lending:** Opt-in since October 2025 (off by default)
- **Foreign account obligation:** You must declare both your DEGIRO and Flatex accounts to the Belgian National Bank and in your annual tax return

## MeDirect

- **Headquarters:** Belgium
- **Tax handling:** Handles TOB, dividend tax, Reynders tax, and CGT automatically (CGT via automatic withholding, with opt-out available since end of January 2026)
- **Fees:** All ETFs commission-free since August 2025
- Be aware they make money through other channels (spreads, fund fees)

## Comparison Table

| Feature | Saxo Bank | Bolero (KBC) | DEGIRO | MeDirect |
|---------|-----------|--------------|--------|----------|
| Country | Denmark (Belgian branch) | Belgium | Netherlands | Belgium |
| IWDA buy cost (€1k) | ~€2 | ~€5 | Lowest | €0 |
| TOB handling | Automatic | Automatic | Automatic | Automatic |
| Dividend tax | Automatic | Automatic | Manual | Automatic |
| Reynders tax | Automatic | Automatic | Manual | Automatic |
| CGT handling | Automatic | Automatic | Manual | Automatic |
| Foreign account declaration | No | No | Yes (2 accounts) | No |
| Securities lending | No | No | Opt-in | No |

## Recommendation

Saxo Bank is the pragmatic starting point — competitive fees with full tax handling. You can always open a DEGIRO account later once you understand the tax admin.
