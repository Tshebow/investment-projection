# Investment Strategy

## Emergency Fund

Before investing, set aside **3–6 months of living expenses** in a savings account. This money stays liquid and out of the market — it's your buffer against unexpected costs (job loss, medical bills, car repairs).

Only invest what remains after your emergency fund is fully funded.

## Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)

DCA means investing a fixed amount at regular intervals (typically monthly) rather than investing a lump sum all at once.

### Why DCA?

- **Reduces timing risk:** You buy at various price points over time, averaging out market volatility
- **Psychologically easier:** Deploying €70k all at once is stressful — spreading it over 12–24 months is more comfortable
- **Disciplined habit:** Monthly investing becomes automatic and removes emotional decision-making

### DCA for a lump sum

When you have a large amount to invest (e.g., €70k), you can DCA it over a chosen period:

- **6 months** — More aggressive, gets money into the market faster
- **12 months** — Balanced approach, one full market cycle
- **18 months** — More conservative, smoother entry
- **24 months** — Most cautious, but money sits uninvested longer

Statistically, lump-sum investing beats DCA about two-thirds of the time (because markets trend upward). But DCA wins on peace of mind and risk management for most people.

### Ongoing monthly contributions

After the initial DCA period, continue investing a fixed monthly amount (e.g., €500–€2,000). This is the core engine of long-term wealth building — consistent monthly contributions over 20–30 years, combined with compound growth.

## Long-Term Holding Strategy

### Buy and hold

The strategy is simple: buy accumulating world ETFs monthly and hold them for 20+ years. Don't try to time the market. Don't sell during downturns.

### CGT-aware withdrawal planning

When it's time to withdraw (retirement, major purchase), the 2026 CGT rules make it worth planning:

- **Spread withdrawals across multiple years** to use the €10,000 annual exemption (indexed to inflation)
- **FIFO applies:** Your earliest (and likely most profitable) shares are sold first
- With enough years of staggered selling, your effective CGT can be significantly reduced or even €0
- Example: If your total gain is €150k, selling over 15 years at ~€10k gain/year means zero CGT

### Rebalancing (IWDA + EMIM only)

If you choose the IWDA + EMIM combo, rebalance once per year to maintain the 90/10 split. Do this by directing new purchases toward the underweight fund — avoid selling just to rebalance (which would trigger TOB and potentially CGT).
