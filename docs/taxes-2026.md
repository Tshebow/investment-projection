# Belgian Tax Rules (2026 Edition)

Belgium introduced a capital gains tax on January 1, 2026. This document covers all relevant taxes for ETF investors.

## TOB — Taks op Beursverrichtingen (Transaction Tax)

A tax paid every time you buy or sell a security.

- **0.12%** — Most ETFs (including IWDA, EMIM)
- **1.32%** — Certain accumulating ETFs registered in Belgium (including VWCE)
- **0.35%** — Other categories (not commonly relevant for standard world ETFs)

### Maximum caps per transaction

| TOB rate | Maximum cap |
|----------|-------------|
| 0.12% | €1,300 |
| 0.35% | €1,600 |
| 1.32% | €4,000 |

Belgian brokers withhold TOB automatically. On a €2,000 monthly buy of IWDA, that's €2.40/month.

## CGT — Capital Gains Tax (10%)

The major 2026 change. A 10% tax on realized capital gains on financial assets.

### Key rules

- **Rate:** 10% on realized gains
- **Annual exemption:** €10,000 — first €10k of gains per year is tax-free
- **Exemption is indexed to inflation** — the €10,000 is the 2026 starting amount, adjusted yearly
- **Carry-forward:** If you don't use your full exemption, you can carry forward €1,000 to the next year, up to a maximum exemption of €15,000
- **Loss offset:** Losses can only offset gains in the same tax year — they cannot be carried forward
- **Snapshot date:** Gains realized before January 1, 2026 remain completely untaxed. The reference date is December 31, 2025
- **FIFO principle:** Your earliest purchases are sold first

### Transition rule (2026–2030)

For pre-2026 holdings, you may use the **original purchase price** if it is higher than the December 31, 2025 snapshot value. This protects investors who bought at prices above the year-end 2025 level.

### FIFO and pre-2026 holdings

For holdings of the same asset purchased before 2026, FIFO uses a **weighted average** of all pre-2026 purchase prices rather than tracking each individual lot.

### Belgian broker handling

Belgian brokers will handle CGT withholding automatically, but may over-withhold — you'd claim back excess via your annual tax return. MeDirect offers automatic withholding with an opt-out option (available since end of January 2026).

### Practical impact

If you're investing monthly and holding long-term, CGT matters most when you start withdrawing. The €10k annual exemption means you can strategically sell in smaller batches across multiple years to minimize the hit.

## Reynders Tax (30%)

Applied to capital gains on funds consisting of **at least 10% bonds**.

- **Rate:** 30% on the bond component's gains
- **Pure equity ETFs** (IWDA, VWCE) are **exempt**
- Only becomes relevant if you add bond ETFs or mixed funds to your portfolio

### Coexistence with CGT

The Reynders tax coexists with the new 10% CGT. For mixed funds: the bond portion is taxed at 30% (Reynders), the equity portion at 10% (CGT). There is no double taxation — each portion is taxed under its respective regime.

## Dividend Tax (30%)

Applies to distributed dividends.

- **Rate:** 30%
- **Accumulating ETFs** (like IWDA and VWCE) reinvest dividends internally — **you pay nothing**
- This is the simplest tax optimization: choose accumulating over distributing ETFs

## Foreign Account Declaration

If you use a foreign broker (DEGIRO, Trade Republic, etc.):

- You must declare the account to the **Belgian National Bank**
- You must report it in your **annual tax return**
- Belgian brokers (Saxo Belgian branch, Bolero, MeDirect) do not require this
